# Challenge

Note: This challenge builds off Inception CTF: Dream 1,

Unfortunately, the subconscious isnâ€™t enough for this mission, we have to kidnap Fischer we need to go further into the system of the mind. Use the flag found to edit the PowerShell script, entering the Flag in line three in-between the single quotes. Run the PowerShell script and wait for it to complete its actions.

Thanks to SRA for providing this challenge!

# Solution

The VanChase.7z contained a hex-code. Decoding the hex-code revealed the flag:

`RITSEC{WaterUnderTheBridge}`

...to be continued in Inception CTF: Dream 3
