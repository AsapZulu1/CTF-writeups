### Challenge
I wonder if ChungusBot has the flag.

### LÃ¸sning
I starded finding the bot and dming it. There was a hint to chack out the code.
A quick search, and I found this:
https://github.com/itsecgary/ChungusBot

By exploring the code I eventually found the correct command-sequence to get the flag. There was also a time limit, so I had to be quick about it.
The sequence was:
```
\>chungusboi kyle
\>flag yeeee
\>chungy mcchungus
\>gagagaga chungusisgod
\>gagagaga giveittome
```

The flag:
> UMDCTF-{I\_th1nk\_y0u\_4r3\_th3\_b0t\_n0w\_sh3333333333sh}
